## üéØ Objectives

### Master 1 Objectives
The goal of the Master 1 program is to immerse students in the three main domains of cybersecurity: offensive security, defensive security, and governance, risk, and compliance (GRC). This year is crucial as it provides a comprehensive overview of the major roles in cybersecurity, helping students make informed decisions about their specialization in the fifth year. This foundational knowledge is essential for understanding the complex nature of cybersecurity, which inherently involves multiple disciplines.

### Master 2 Objectives
The Master 2 program aims to develop true expertise in one of the three domains (offensive, defensive, GRC) while also acquiring strong transversal skills to professionalize students. The goal is to create rare profiles: experts in their field with a broad understanding of cybersecurity challenges and professional skills such as project management, leadership, and public speaking. Students will choose one of three specializations and engage in research through a thesis related to their major. They will also take generalist modules to consolidate their overall understanding and professional abilities.
